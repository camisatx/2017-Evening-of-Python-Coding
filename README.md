# 2017 - An Evening of Python Coding Talk - Tenacity

I will give this short talk on the [tenacity](https://github.com/jd/tenacity) Python library at a future [An Evening of Python Coding](https://www.meetup.com/austinpython/) event.

Tenacity is a library that uses decorators to **retry** a specific task after an Exception occurs. Retrying occurs at the specified intervals for a specified duration.

## Presentation Instructions

I wrote this talk within a Jupyter Notebook, thus make sure you have Jupyter and Python installed. The easiest way to get this working is to download and install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

Steps:
1. Download the repository
2. Open the terminal within the main repository folder ('2017-Evening-of-Python-Coding')
3. Run `jupyter notebook` in the terminal to start the Jupyter server on your computer
4. Within your browser, click to open `tenacity.ipynb` and the notebook will open 
5. To run a specific section in the notebook, either press `Ctrl` + `Enter` on your keyboard, or click on the `run cell` button in the Toolbar.
